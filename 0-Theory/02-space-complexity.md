> **Space Complexity = Auxiliary Space + Input Space**

## ðŸ“Œ What is Space Complexity?

Space Complexity refers to the **total memory** an algorithm needs to run, relative to the **input size**.

It includes:

- ðŸ§® **Input Space**: Memory used to store input
- ðŸ§° **Auxiliary Space**: Extra space your algorithm creates to solve the problem

## ðŸ§ª Example

```java
int a = 5;   // input
int b = 6;   // input
int c = a + b; // auxiliary space
```
